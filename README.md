# Social Distance Drawing 

Social Distance Drawing is a drawing app/game where you can draw with friends. the app is built on Socket.io for the real-time communications, and WebRTC for the built-in calling functionality.

The front-end is built on vanilla JavaScript (yes, I know, big mistake), and Express.js for the server. This is a fun little quarantine project I made on my free time, but feel free to contribute!
